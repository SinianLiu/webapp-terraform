# Stages for each Development envolvement:
1. Setup local development environment and sign up for cloud & SaaS services the project needs to use
- git organization repo
- GCP 

2. Built an node.js app with several APIs, decided on the ORM and database it needs to use

3. 
- Set up <GitHub Repository Branch Protection Rules> for the organization repo, fork the repo in my namespace and work on the fork in the future
- Work on retails of RESTful APIs and basic authentication
- Implement Continuous Integration (CI) with GitHub Actions Status check workflow

4. 
- Install gcloud CLI
- Infrastructure as Code: Setup networking resources such as Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Internet Gateway, Route Table, and Routes using Terraform
- Implement integration tests in GitHub Actions workflow
